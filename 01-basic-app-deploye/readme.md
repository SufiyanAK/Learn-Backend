# Today's Backend Learning Progress

## Overview

Today, I made significant progress in my backend development journey, focusing on core concepts related to Express.js and handling environment variables.

## Key Accomplishments

- **Express Routes**: Successfully built and implemented several routes in Express.js. This includes managing different types of requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **Environment Variables**: Learned how to securely manage sensitive data using `.env` files. I now understand how to configure and load these variables in an Express app.

## Next Steps

Moving forward, I will dive deeper into these topics:
- **Deep Study**: I plan to explore advanced topics like middleware, routing strategies, and authentication in Express.js.
- **Database Integration**: I aim to integrate core databases like SQL or MongoDB, which will give me a strong foundation for building scalable applications.
