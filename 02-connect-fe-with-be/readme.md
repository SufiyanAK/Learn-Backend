# Connecting Frontend with Backend

## Learning

In this project, I learned how to connect the **frontend** with the **backend** using an API. It was a good experience because it helped me understand how data flows between both sides of a web application.

### Key Concepts I Learned:

- **API Creation**: 
   - I built a small API that allowed data to be sent from the backend to the frontend.
   - This gave me a better understanding of how servers and clients communicate.
- **Axios for HTTP Requests**:
   - I used **Axios** in the frontend to send a request to the API and get data back.
   - It made handling HTTP requests simple and efficient.

- **CORS Policy**:
   - Since the frontend and backend were running on different ports, I had to learn about **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**.
   - Understanding how to manage CORS was essential for allowing communication between the frontend and backend.

- **Ports and Cross-Origin Communication**:
   - Running the frontend and backend on different ports introduced me to challenges with cross-origin communication, and this was a valuable learning moment.

### Reflections:

- This project taught me the importance of API integration in web development.
- I realized how crucial it is to understand both the frontend and backend aspects, especially when building full-stack applications.
- Comparing my progress from just a day ago, I feel I have made significant improvements in my skills.
